# RLECoreEncoder
RLECoreEncoder is a project focused on implementing a parallel run-length encoding (RLE) algorithm for efficient data compression. It explores the use of multithreaded programming with POSIX threads, custom thread pool design, and inter-process communication mechanisms to achieve optimized and scalable compression performance.

* Docker is required to perform the regular functionality.
